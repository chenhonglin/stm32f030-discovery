# stm32f030-discovery
This project demonstrate usage of PWM. The example using Timer14, output the PWM at pin PB1. The example require physical jumper to short between pin PC9 and PB1 to observe LD3.
In pwm.c there is a #define PWM_PB1_BLINK to demonstrate differnt frequency of PWM output waveform.
